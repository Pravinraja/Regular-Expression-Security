# Regular-Expression-Security
Regular Expression Security Test with Python

Create a Python Program that will ask the user for a password (use input)

Verify that the password meets the following conditions:

-must be at least 12 characters long

-must have uppercase and lowercase

-must contain at least 1 special character (!~#$%^&*{}+_)

-must be a mix of numbers and letters

You must do this only using regular expressions so for instance this will not be accepted

if len(password) <12:

 

At the end of the program tell the user their password is ok or not ok
